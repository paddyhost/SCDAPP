    <string name="Solar_conduction_Drayer">Solar Conduction Dryer is a solar powered food
dehydrator. It reduces moisture content in agro and
marine  produces  so  that  their  shelf-life  could  be
increased up-to 1year.</string>
    <string name="dehydration" formatted="false">\n\u2022Fresh products ( fruits, vegetables, ﬁshes etc. ) have moisture contents of about 70–95%. At these values, the product is subject to deteriorate very quickly  as  microorganisms  are  very  active.  Solar  Conduction  Dryer  can remove moisture content to about 5–15%.
    \n\u2022At these levels, depending on the type of the product-the products are
free from microorganism reactions or activities.
    \n\u2022Food dehydration together with food preservation aims to prolong the
shelf life of agricultural products, control the seasonal variation of food
supply, stabilise the marketing of agricultural products and improve the
food quality.</string>


    <string name="location_description" formatted="false">\u2022SCD should be installed at a clean , hygienic and dust free place.
\n\u2022Where ever possible, concrete ﬂooring is recommended, to
  prevent the contamination by dust etc.
\n\u2022Installation place should get the sunlight through out the day i.e.
  should be shadow-free, to maximize the utilization of solar
  thermal energy.
\n\u2022SCD should be placed in such a way that its chimney (central
  hood) is parallel to the East-West direction. In other words, trays
  should be operated in North-South direction.</string>
    <string name="food_hygiene" formatted="false">The following factors should be observed when processing
food using Solar ConductionDryer technology:
\n\u2022The processor (personnel)cleanliness
\n\u2022The processing place (room) cleanliness
\n\u2022The equipment and tools cleanliness
\n\u2022General processing cleanliness
\nWhile preparing material to be dried, one must consider:
\n\u2022Selection of quality fruits/ vegetables/ﬁshes
\n\u2022Washing
\n\u2022Peeling
\n\u2022Cutting or slicing into small pieces</string>

    <string name="procedure" formatted="false">\u2022Trays should be cleaned with soft cloth and mild dish-washing
  liquid before use. Excess water/ juice should be drained off
  from the sliced  material before loading.
\n\u202270-80% of the area on the trays should be evenly covered with
  the single layer of material to be dried.20-30% of the black
  surface should be evenly exposed to solar radiations, it will act
  as a heat-absorber.
\n\u2022It is recommended to load dryers in the morning as early as
  possible. It  is also recommended to unload dryers when the
  product is dried.
\n\u2022In case the material is very sticky, it should be turned up side
  down, intermediately, to avoid sticking to the trays.
\n\u2022In last stage of drying, material should be inspected to prevent
  over-drying.</string>
    <string name="factor">The  drying  time  is  very  subjective  entity  and  it  depends  on variety of factors such as:
\n\u2022 Slices/ cuts and layer Depth of the Drying Material
\n\u2022Solar Radiation Intensity
\n\u2022Ambient Temperature
\n\u2022Relative Humidity</string>
